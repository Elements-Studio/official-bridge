# Emergency Pause - Pre-signed Signatures Template
#
# Alternative to storing private keys: use pre-signed pause signatures.
# These signatures can be generated offline on a secure machine and stored here.
#
# Generate signatures using the bridge CLI or custom signing tool.

# ETH chain pause signatures
eth_pause_signatures:
  # Signature from committee member 1
  - member_address: "0x..."  # ETH address of signer
    signature: "0x..."       # Hex-encoded signature bytes
    voting_power: 5001       # Voting power of this member
    
  # Signature from committee member 2 (optional, for redundancy)
  - member_address: "0x..."
    signature: "0x..."
    voting_power: 1

# Starcoin chain pause signatures
starcoin_pause_signatures:
  # Signature from committee member 1
  - member_address: "0x..."  # Starcoin address of signer (32 hex chars)
    signature: "0x..."        # Hex-encoded signature bytes
    voting_power: 5001
    
  # Signature from committee member 2 (optional, for redundancy)
  - member_address: "0x..."
    signature: "0x..."
    voting_power: 1

# Notes:
# - Total voting power from signatures must meet the pause threshold (e.g., 450)
# - Signatures are for emergency pause action (nonce should match current state)
# - Generate new signatures after each governance nonce increment
# - Store this file securely (chmod 600)
